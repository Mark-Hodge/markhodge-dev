        "bio": "Hi, I am Mark Hodge. I have been a Software Engineer in the logistics industry for over 3 years now primarily working on backend projects. My frontend skills are self-taught and this website is part of that. I am originally from Louisisana but earned my degree in Engineering from Mississippi State University in 2020. Hail State! After college, work brought me to Arkansas where I am based now. I am also a Commissioned Officer in the Arkansas Army National Guard, currently in the process to become an Army Aviator and hopefully fly BlackHawk helicopters for the state and the US Army. I love coffee, the outdoors, history, and personal finance. I have the technical skills that make me a good developer but my wrath of other skills both non-technical and technical make me a valuable assett to any business.",
